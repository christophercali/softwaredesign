                <h1>The Supreme Court and the Conservative Super Majority</h1>
            </header>

            <p>
                Donald Trump was able to appoint 3 judges to the Supreme Court of the United States: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett.  
                </p> 
            <p>
                These 3 appointees, along with the existing conservative side of the court, make up a conservative super majority. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Most recently, this 6-3 conservative super majority overturned Roe V Wade, a decision that had protected a woman's right to an abortion. Following this decision, many states passed restrictive laws making it illegal to get an abortion. Their overturning of Roe V Wade went against a 50 year precendent and public opionion.
            </p>
            <h3>Clarence & Ginni Thomas</h3>
            <p>Most recently, the NY Times did an investigation into Ginni Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. They found that Ginni supported Trump's attempt to overturn the 2020 election.</p>
