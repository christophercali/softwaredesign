    <p>As families grow and generations change, familial history is often lost. 
    
    In an effort to document family history before it is lost, I have created an exploratory web installation, which I hope is engaging and interesting.</p>

    Join me in exploring the great (meant in both senses of the word) grandparents of the Cali and Lengua families and more.
